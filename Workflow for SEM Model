# We only wants columns 5 through 17 since the first couple columns will be more for organization
# A key for the organizational columns is separate of this file

## We can get a variance-covariance matrix then transform it to a 
## correlation matrix or go straight to a correlation matrix

## SEM is great for predicting the causation for certain traits
## We aren't getting complicated my questions are simply:
# Does EOY1 rhizome and rhizome bud data indicate BOY2 rhizome and above ground biomass?
# And does Y1 rhizome and rhizome bud data indicate Y2 rhizome and above ground biomass?
## Pretty similar questions but one is looking between months and the other is looking at cumulative influence
## I'm hoping to get a physiological explanation between years essentially with what I have!
# I'll put up pictures of my models in Github as well to illustrate my thinking path
